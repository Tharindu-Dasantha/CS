    <h1>Special Foods in Sri Lanka</h1>
    <div class="contentImg">
        <div class = "topic-box">
            <h3>Fish Curry and Mixed Rice</h3><br>
            <img src="Images/Fish_Curry_and_Mixed_Rice.jpg" alt="">
            <p>There’s nothing more common to eat as Sri Lankan food than a nutritious plate of rice and curry. You normally get a plate of rice piled with a few of the daily vegetable curries and a choice of fish curry as well.</p>>

            <h3>Deviled Sweet and Sour Fish Curry</h3><br>
            <img src="Images/Deviled_Sweet_and_Sour_Fish_Curry.jpg" alt="">
            <p>There are a lot of different deviled dishes in Sri Lanka. This fish was deep fried and smothered in a lovely sweet and sour sauce and lightly fried again with red onions and banana peppers. It was excellent with fried rice and a flatbread paratha on the side.</p>


            <h3>Chili Fish Curry</h3><br>
            <img src="Images/Chili_Fish_Curry.jpg" alt="">
            <p>This particular fish curry in Sri Lanka reminded me of the Burmese food curry that I also highly enjoyed, except it was often a bit heavier on the spice blend, which I loved.

                The fish curry in Sri Lanka was extremely fragrant, oily, and the sauce was marvelous with a giant plate of price.</p>


            <h3>Sri Lankan Dhal Curry (Parippu)</h3><br>
            <img src="Images/Sri_Lankan_Dhal_Curry_(Parippu).jpg" alt="">
            <p> Dhal curry is one of the most commonly consumed staple dishes in Sri Lankan cuisine.

                The dhal, usually masoor dhal which are red lentils, are often cooked in a beautiful blend of spices, and then a few spoons of coconut milk are added to create a rich stew.

                Dhal curry is omnipresent in Sri Lanka, and it’s consumed with all forms of rice and bread.</p>


            <h3>Young Jackfruit Curry (Polos)</h3><br>
            <img src="Images/Young_Jackfruit_Curry_(Polos).jpg" alt="">
            <p>Sri Lankan food is famous for its curries – and “polos“, or young jackfruit curry, is one of my personal favorites.

                Jackfruit is eaten in a number of different ripeness stages in Sri Lanka, but for preparing polos, the young, unripe jackfruit is used. The fruit is cut into chunks and simmered in a blend of rich spices.

                This particular version (brown dish above) was so delicious, I couldn’t stop eating it. The pieces of jackfruit were tender, and tasted almost like a juicier version of a potato, and they were filled with the beautiful flavor spices.

                Polos is so good, it could almost pass for chunks of tender beef!</p>


            <h3>Gotukola Sambol (Pennywort Salad)</h3><br>
            <img src="Images/Gotukola_Sambol_(Pennywort_Salad).jpg" alt="">
            <p>Green leafy vegetables aren’t the most common thing to eat in Sri Lanka, though the cooking does call for many tuberous vegetables. But anyway, since I love green veggies, I ate a dish known as Gotukola Sambol, frequently during my visit.

                Gotukola is the word for Asiatic pennywort, a small leafy green vegetable that’s common throughout southeast Asia. Sambol is the word used to describe a dish or garnish that prepared and eaten using raw ingredients. So gotukola sambol is a basically Sri Lankan salad garnish.

                The gotukola is first sliced very finely, then mixed with grated coconut meat, red onions, and a few extra spices for seasoning. Asiatic pennywort has a very green flavor, I think it can be compared to the green flavor of kale, and it’s refreshing and crisp.

                I think I could call it the Middle Eastern tabbouleh of Sri Lanka.</p>>

            <h3>Beetroot Curry</h3><br>
            <img src="Images/Beetroot_Curry.jpg" alt="">
            <p>A plate of Sri Lankan curry and rice is complete only when a nice helping of beetroot curry is included! No that’s not really true, you can have a plate of curry without beetroot. However, when I was traveling in Sri Lanka, I came to love the beetroot curry – it’s such a wonderful dish.

                The beets are diced up before being cooked to death with a number of spices including cinnamon and curry leaves. The beets are nice and soft, and rich in flavor.

                Throughout the duration of my stay, I just couldn’t get enough of this blood red vegetable, that tastes so good with other curries.</p>



            <h3>Cheese Kottu</h3><br>
            <img src="Images/Cheese_Kottu.jpg" alt="">
            <p>If vegetarian kottu is the hamburger of Sri Lanka, cheese kottu is the quadruple bacon cheeseburger.

                Yellow curry powder flavor is bumped up a few notches with cheese kottu and it’s a Sri Lankan food that you just can’t miss. The cheese is not traditional yellow cheese, but rather more like cottage milk cheese.</p>>

            <h3>Fried Salted Fish</h3><br>
            <img src="Images/Fried_Salted_Fish.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Little fried and salted fish are a lovely addition to Sri Lankan food. Unlike saucy curry, little fish are heavily salted and deep fried so they are crunchy. Their texture and flavor goes well with a plate of vegetarian curry and rice.

                Also, Maldive fish are a popular ingredient for Sri Lankan dishes. The little salted fish are included in a range of different sambol chili sauces and they are often included in lunu miris, an onion chili sauce that goest with all sorts of Sri Lankan dishes.</p>>

            <h3>Deep Fried Chicken Fried Rice</h3><br>
            <img src="Images/Deep_Fried_Chicken_Fried_Rice.jpg" alt="">
            <p>If only more countries in the world knew about fried chicken fried rice, it would be integrated into cuisines around the world…guaranteed.

                I don’t think there’s much need for explanation; Take fried chicken and make fried rice with it.</p>>


            <h3>Sri Lankan Chicken Curry (kukul mas curry)</h3><br>
            <img src="Images/Sri_Lankan_Chicken_Curry_(kukul_mas_curry).jpg" alt="">
            <p>I have read that Sri Lankan food is difficult to master, simply because everyone has their own variation of each dish, and previously no recipes were written; Basically no chicken curry will taste exactly the same throughout the country, everyone has their own recipe and ratio of spices and ingredients.

                When I was in Pusselawa, I had the privilege to stay at a grandmother’s home in the rolling tea fields. Everyday I’d go to the market and buy some meat and she’d cook it up, tempering the spices, squeezing fresh coconut milk, and creating some of the best curries I’ve ever had in my life.

                This clay pot of Grandmother’s home-made chicken curry goes down as one of the top 10 flavors that has ever entered my mouth.</p>
