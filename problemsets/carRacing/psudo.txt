Inputs:-
    int T -- number of cases
    for each case: 
        R -- length of the track
        C  -- number of cars
        for each car:-
            C_id -- car identifier
            Cs -- cars normal speed
            Ct -- cars turbo speed  (meters per second)
            Cc -- cars turbo cooldown time (seconds)
            Cd -- cars turbo boost duratin time (seconds)

Outputs :-
    must contain T lines 
    order -- (" Case #t: C_id ")   t -- number of the case



the race only have seconds every second car will teleport to the position of its speed
every car can activate a boost for a limited time when activated it will work constantly untill it runs Out
after cc seconds it will recharged 
in the beging every car has full boost 

which car will completer the track first print the id of the car 
when in a tie the smallest id number will be the winner




#### for the first test the answer should be 
    Case #1: 1
    Case #2: 2




# for my purpose only
every single time the turbo is filled up they will use it
