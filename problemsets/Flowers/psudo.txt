must plant F flowers in a field 
To grow well every plant must be as far apart as possible
field ia a rectangle in size of W X H
distance between two flowers can be calculated using manhattan distance 
manhattan distance:-        Dist((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) = |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|
also the  miminum distance between any two flowers
Dist_field = min(Dist((xi, yi), (xj, yj)))
Task:- find the minimum distance to plant all the flowers in a field



INPUTS:- 
first line number of cases to solve T
for t in T 
W - width of the field
H - height of the field
F - the number of flowers to plant
G - the number of ground patches in the field free of rocks
then next for g in G lines
cordinates og ground patches, one per line in the format X, Y where X is the column and Y is the row  ( cordinate values starts with 0, Upper left corner of the field has cordinate(0,0))

OUTPUT:-
template :- Case #t: D 
D is the miminum distance between any two flowers
