Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent wa
y for writers to get their creative flo
w going at the beginning of the day. The writ
er has no idea what topic the random paragraph
will be about when it appears. This forces the w
riter to use creativity to complete one of three
common writing challenges. The writer can use the par
agraph as the first one of a short story and build u
pon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhe
re in a short story they create. The third option is to have the random par
agraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No m
atter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer 
is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.
